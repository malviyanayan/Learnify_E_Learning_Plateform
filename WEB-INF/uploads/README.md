## User Data Storage

After registration, a dedicated folder will be created for each user under the `APPLICATION_USERS` directory.  
This folder will store all important user-related data, including:

- **Course videos**  
- **Profile images**  
- **Other user-specific content**

> Each folder is named after the registered email name, ensuring organized and secure storage of user data.
