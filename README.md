<!-- ## 💾 User Data Storage

After registration, each user gets a dedicated folder under `APPLICATION_USERS`.  
This folder stores all important user-specific data:

- Course videos
- Profile images
- Other content

> Each folder is named after the username for organized and secure storage. -->

# ⚙️ How To Run

## Steps to Run This Application

1. **Install Apache Tomcat Server**
   - Download and install **Apache Tomcat** (preferably version 9 or above).
   - Set up the Tomcat environment variables (`CATALINA_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`) properly.

---

2. **Clone the GitHub Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malviyanayan/Learnify_E_Learning_Plateform.git
```

3. **Move the Project Folder to Tomcat Webapps Directory**

```bash
move Learnify_E_Learning_Plateform "C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.85\webapps\"
This places your project inside the Tomcat webapps folder so it can be deployed automatically when the server starts.
```

4. **Setup Database**
   - Open the `queries.db` file in any text editor.
   - Copy all the SQL queries and run them in your MySQL command line to create the required database and tables.

<!-- ````bash
mysql -u root -p
mysql> source path/to/queries.db;
```` -->

5. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Go to `WEB-INF/src/utils/Database.java`.
   - Update your MySQL username and password in the connection code.
```java
private static final String USER = "your_mysql_username";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
```

6. **(Optional) Configure Email Sending Feature**  
   - To enable email sending (for OTPs, notifications, etc.). 
   - You can Edit this According to your need. 

```text
WEB-INF/src/utils/Email.java
Update your sender email address and the 12-character app password (generated from your email provider).

Example (Gmail users): create an App Password and paste it into the code.
```

7. **Compile Java Code**
   - Open the `WEB-INF/src` directory in your command line and run the following command to compile all Java files:
```bash
javac -cp ".;../lib/*" -d ../classes controllers/*.java models/*.java utils/*.java listeners/*.java
```

8. **Run the Application**
   - Start your Tomcat server:
```bash
cd /path/to/tomcat/bin
startup.bat    # For Windows
./startup.sh   # For Linux/Mac
```

9. **Access the Application Dashboard**
   - Once the server is running, go to your browser and open:
```text
http://localhost:8080/Learnify_E_Learning_Plateform
```
